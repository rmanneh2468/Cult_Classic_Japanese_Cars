        <p>Description:</p> 
        <div id = "Twoforty_descrip">
            <p>The Nissan 240sx was an agile, lightweight, Rear-Wheel Drive sports car. The car was
            available, with a 5-speed manual transmission. Due to all of these factors, it gained
            a large following of spirited fans, in the racing, autocross, and drifting communities.
            The car holds a legendary status, in the communities, of fans of 90's Japanese sports 
            cars. In fact, it is such a popular and desired car, that it is nearly impossible to find 
            a used 240sx, that has not been abused by a racer, or modded extensively.
