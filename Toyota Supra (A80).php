        <p>Description:</p>
        
        <p>The A80 Toyota Supra, (aka "Mark 4" Supra), was a truly special car. It was a very well-built, 
        fast, and good-handling machine. The Turbo version of the Mark 4 Supra, was lighter, had more 
        torque, more horsepower, better suspension, and a more sophisticated engine, (the 2JZ-GTE), than the 
        previous Supra, (the A70, Mark 3 Supra, which ran from 1986-1992, in North America). The smooth, 
        rounded lines of the Mk4, have a very "90's look", yet still look appealing today. The Mk4 and
        the Mk3 Toyota Supra, have nearly opposite looks, which adds to the polarizing fanbase, that both
        models have. Some Toyota Supra fans, prefer the edgy, wedge-shaped, angular, and aggressive look, 
        of the Mark 3. Nevertheless, the Mark 4 is a legendary GT car, which generates very high prices, on 
        the used car market, and for good reason. There are few cars that can match its combination of speed, 
        handling, looks, driving experience, swagger, and great reliability.
