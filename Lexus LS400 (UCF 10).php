        <p>Description:</p>
        
        <p>The A80 Toyota Supra, (aka "Mark 4" Supra), was a truly special car. It was a well-built, 
        fast, and good-handling machine. The Turbo version of the Mark 4 Supra, was lighter, had more 
        torque, more horsepower, better suspension, and a more sophisticated engine, (the 2JZ-GTE), than the 
        previous Supra, (the A70, Mark 3 Supra, which ran from 1986-1992, in North America). The smooth, 
        rounded lines of the Mk4, have a very "90's look", yet still look appealing today. The Mk3 and
        the Mk4 Toyota Supra, have very different designs, which adds to the polarizing fanbase, that both
        models have. The Mark 4 Supra is an iconic and legendary GT car, that generates very high prices, on the 
        used car market. Some people are surprised by the high prices, that these cars sell for. Yet
        there are few cars, that can match it's combination of speed, handling, looks, driving 
        experience, and great reliability.
